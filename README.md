# OpenGov Africa — Fundraising Team

Welcome to the Fundraising Team. This repository is the single source of truth for fundraising activities, campaign ideas, donor logs, and reporting. Use it to coordinate work, record outcomes, and keep our community informed.

- **Identify and Engage Donors:** Build relationships with individuals, companies, and institutions who care about governance in Africa.
- **Run Fundraising Campaigns:** Plan and execute donation drives, community challenges, and recurring giving programs.
- **Write and Submit Grants:** Research opportunities, draft proposals, and follow up with funders.
- **Track Donations:** Maintain transparent records of contributions and campaigns.

## How to log fundraising activity

Every action or result should be recorded as a GitHub issue using the Fundraising Update template:

- Open a new issue with the template:  
  [https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/fundraising/issues/new?template=custom-fundraising-update.md](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/fundraising/issues/new?template=custom-fundraising-update.md)

Fill in the date, type of update (donation, campaign, grant progress), amount (if any), channel, outcome, and follow-up actions. Tag relevant team members and add any supporting links or screenshots.

---

## Reporting cadence

- **Daily** — add immediate or time-sensitive entries as issues (if required).  
- **Weekly** — each contributor should ensure their week’s activities are logged by Friday.  
- **Monthly** — the lead prepares the Monthly Fundraising Report using `monthly-report-template.md` and posts it in Discussions and links it in the repo.

Files:
- [Monthly report template](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/fundraising/blob/main/monthly-report-template.md)  
- [Funds tracker](https://github.com/OpenGovAfrica/fundraising/blob/main/funds-tracker.md) (update within 24 hours of confirmation)
